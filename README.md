# Simply Youtuber

Simply Youtuber is a YouTube app that allows users to browse and view videos from YouTube channels. By using the YouTube data API, the app can access information about public YouTube channels and videos, such as the channel's name, description, and videos. The app likely has a list screen that allows users to view a list of videos from a selected channel, and a player screen that provides more information about a selected video and allows the user to play it.
